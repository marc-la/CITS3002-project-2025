## 4.1 Custom Packet Protocol and Checksum

To address T4.1, we designed a custom protocol layered over TCP, using structured packets with a fixed-format header. Each packet contains a 16-bit sequence number, a packet type (DATA, ACK, or NACK), a payload length, and a 16-bit checksum. Payloads are capped at 512 bytes to ensure compliance with project requirements.

Checksum integrity is enforced using a custom function that detects corrupted payloads. If a corrupted packet is received, a `ChecksumError` is raised and a NACK is sent to trigger retransmission. This mechanism meets the requirement for error detection and recovery. Sequence mismatches raise a `SequenceError`, ensuring packets are reassembled in order.

For T4.3, the protocol adds encryption using AES-CBC. Encrypted DATA packets include a random IV prepended to the ciphertext, enabling secure decryption on the receiver’s end. ACK and NACK packets remain unencrypted as specified.

We validated the checksum’s effectiveness with a statistical demo in `stats_demo.py`, introducing random bit-flips and measuring detection rates. Results confirmed the checksum reliably detects corruption.

Overall, this design satisfies Tier 4 requirements for robust packet structure, error detection, and secure payload handling, while adhering to TCP layering constraints set out in the project specification.
