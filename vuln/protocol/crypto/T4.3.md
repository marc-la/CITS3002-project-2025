# Encryption Layer (T4.3) — Design and Implementation

This protocol implements a basic symmetric encryption scheme using **AES in Counter (CTR) mode**, ensuring confidentiality and resilience against replay attacks and payload corruption. The encryption logic is encapsulated in the `Packet` class, specifically targeting `DATA` packets.

---

## Symmetric Encryption Scheme

- **AES-CTR** is used, allowing safe encryption of arbitrary-length payloads without padding.
- Chosen for its parallelisability, efficiency, and ability to turn AES into a secure stream cipher.
- Encryption and decryption are handled by the `encrypt_payload()` and `decrypt_payload()` functions in the `crypto.aes` module.

---

## Key Exchange

- **Key exchange is out-of-scope** for this protocol.
- Assumes an out-of-band pre-shared key, `SHARED_KEY`, securely loaded from the `crypto.key` module.
- Satisfies the requirement to use a shared symmetric key without network key negotiation.

---

## Packet Structure Integration

- Encryption is tightly integrated into the custom packet format (from T4.1).
- When a `Packet` of type `DATA` is initialised:
  1. A random 16-byte IV is generated via `generate_iv()`.
  2. The plaintext payload is encrypted using AES-CTR with the IV and `SHARED_KEY`.
  3. The IV is prepended to the encrypted payload and included as part of the packet’s payload field.
  4. The packet's checksum is computed over the full IV + ciphertext to ensure integrity before transmission.

- On reception:
  1. Verifies the checksum before decryption to detect corruption.
  2. Extracts the IV from the first 16 bytes of the payload.
  3. Decrypts the remainder using the same key and IV.

- **Decryption only occurs after integrity is verified.**

---

## Replay Attack Mitigation

- Mitigated through per-packet random IV generation.
- AES-CTR encrypts based on both key and IV, so repeated payloads with different IVs yield different ciphertexts.
- Random IVs ensure intercepted/replayed packets do not match expected ciphertexts and are discarded or misaligned by sequence enforcement.

---

## Corruption Handling and IV Management

- Packet corruption is detected using a 16-bit checksum, computed over the encrypted payload (including the IV).
- If verification fails, a `ChecksumError` is raised and a NACK packet is sent to request retransmission.
- The IV is 16 bytes (128 bits), matching the AES block size and best practices.
- IV is generated securely and randomly for each packet, preventing key-stream reuse and strengthening encryption reliability.
