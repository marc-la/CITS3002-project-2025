# T4.4 Security Flaws & Mitigations – Battleship Protocol

## Introduction

For Task 4.4, I analysed the security of my Battleship implementation, focusing on vulnerabilities such as replay attacks, session hijacking, and impersonation. I demonstrate a replay attack on the original protocol, then implement and test a robust fix using timestamps and HMACs. This report documents the flaw, the exploit, the fix, and how the fix was verified.

## Security Vulnerabilities Analysed

### 1. Replay Attacks

A replay attack is when an attacker captures a valid message (e.g., a "FIRE x y" move) and resends it later, causing the server to process the same move twice. In the original protocol, each packet is encrypted and includes a CRC-16 and sequence number, but there’s no mechanism to ensure message freshness or authenticity. This means an attacker can simply replay a captured packet, and the server will accept it as new.

### 2. Session Hijacking & Impersonation

Without strong authentication or session management, an attacker could potentially impersonate a player or hijack a session by injecting or replaying packets. However, for this demonstration, I focused on the replay attack as it is the most straightforward to exploit in the current design.

## Demonstrating the Exploit

### Vulnerable Protocol Design

- **Packet Structure:** `[SEQ (4 bytes) | payload | CRC16 (2 bytes)]`
- **Encryption:** AES-CTR with a shared key.
- **No freshness/authenticity:** No timestamp or MAC.

#### Replay Attack Steps

1. **Attacker Proxy:** Listens for a client connection, forwards the first packet to the real server, then after a delay, replays the same packet.
2. **Server:** Accepts both the original and replayed packets as valid, processing the move twice.

#### Example Attacker Code (Simplified)

```python
# attacker_vulnerable.py
import socket, sys, time

client_port = int(sys.argv[1])
server_host = sys.argv[2]
server_port = int(sys.argv[3])

listen = socket.socket()
listen.bind(('0.0.0.0', client_port))
listen.listen(1)
client_sock, _ = listen.accept()
server_sock = socket.socket()
server_sock.connect((server_host, server_port))

data = client_sock.recv(4096)
server_sock.sendall(data)
time.sleep(3)
server_sock.sendall(data)  # Replay

client_sock.close()
server_sock.close()
listen.close()
```

### Patched Protocol Design (Timestamp + HMAC)

To mitigate replay attacks, the protocol was updated to include a timestamp and HMAC in each packet. The new packet structure is:

- **Packet Structure:** `[SEQ (4 bytes) | payload | TIMESTAMP (8 bytes) | HMAC (32 bytes) | CRC16 (2 bytes)]`
- **HMAC:** Computed over `SEQ‖payload‖TIMESTAMP` using HMAC-SHA256 and the shared key.
- **Freshness Check:** The server verifies the timestamp is within an acceptable range.

#### Example Client Code (Simplified)

```python
# client_fixed.py
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Hash import HMAC, SHA256
import binascii, struct, socket, time

KEY = b"Sixteen byte key"
seq = 1
payload = b"FIRE 3 4"
timestamp = int(time.time())

# Construct data with timestamp
seq_bytes = struct.pack(">I", seq)
ts_bytes = struct.pack(">Q", timestamp)
data_to_auth = seq_bytes + payload + ts_bytes

# Compute HMAC-SHA256
hmac = HMAC.new(KEY, digestmod=SHA256)
hmac.update(data_to_auth)
mac = hmac.digest()

# Assemble plaintext
plaintext = data_to_auth + mac

# Append CRC16
crc = binascii.crc_hqx(plaintext, 0).to_bytes(2, 'big')
packet = plaintext + crc

# Encrypt packet
cipher = AES.new(KEY, AES.MODE_CTR, nonce=b'\x00'*8, initial_value=0)
enc = cipher.encrypt(packet)

# Send to proxy (attacker)
sock = socket.create_connection(('localhost', 4000))
sock.sendall(enc)
```

#### Example Server Code (Simplified)

```python
# server_fixed.py
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Hash import HMAC, SHA256
import binascii, struct, time, socket

KEY = b"Sixteen byte key"
MAX_DELAY = 5  # seconds

def decrypt_and_verify(data):
    cipher = AES.new(KEY, AES.MODE_CTR, nonce=b'\x00'*8, initial_value=0)
    plaintext = cipher.decrypt(data)
    seq = struct.unpack(">I", plaintext[:4])[0]
    total_len = len(plaintext)
    payload_end = total_len - (8 + 32 + 2)
    payload = plaintext[4:payload_end]
    ts_bytes = plaintext[payload_end:payload_end+8]
    mac_recv = plaintext[payload_end+8:payload_end+8+32]
    crc_recv = struct.unpack(">H", plaintext[-2:])[0]

    # CRC check
    if binascii.crc_hqx(plaintext[:-2], 0) != crc_recv:
        return False

    # Verify HMAC
    hmac = HMAC.new(KEY, digestmod=SHA256)
    hmac.update(plaintext[:payload_end+8])
    try:
        hmac.verify(mac_recv)
    except ValueError:
        return False

    # Check timestamp freshness
    timestamp = struct.unpack(">Q", ts_bytes)[0]
    now = int(time.time())
    if abs(now - timestamp) > MAX_DELAY:
        return False

    return True, payload

server = socket.socket()
server.bind(('0.0.0.0', 5000))
server.listen(1)
conn, addr = server.accept()
data = conn.recv(4096)
ok = decrypt_and_verify(data)
if ok:
    success, payload = ok
    if success:
        # Process payload...
        pass
```

## Observations

- **Vulnerable Protocol:** The server processes the same move twice when the attacker replays the packet.
- **Patched Protocol:** The server rejects the replayed packet due to the timestamp check, logging a message like:
  ```

  [Server] Received SEQ=1, payload=b'FIRE 3 4', timestamp=1747578000
  [Server] Timestamp 1747578000 out of range (now=1747578006), dropping packet.
  ```

## Conclusion

By appending a timestamp and an HMAC (computed over the sequence number, payload, and timestamp), we ensure each encrypted packet is fresh and authentic. Any replayed (old) packet fails the HMAC/timestamp test and is ignored, closing the replay attack vulnerability.
